# Mr. Handyman Best Practices Checklist

This repository contains a single-page, self-contained HTML application that helps franchise teams verify Mr. Handyman call routing, time frame, and configuration requirements. The checklist persists progress in the browser so work can pause and resume without losing context.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Open the repository **Settings â†’ Pages** configuration.
3. Choose the `main` branch and set the publishing source to the **root** directory.
4. Save the settings. GitHub Pages will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Because the app is a standalone `index.html` file (with embedded CSS and JavaScript), no build step or additional assets are required for deployment.

## Preview locally

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. For example, on macOS you can run:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or serve it through a lightweight static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
